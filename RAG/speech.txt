We shall either free India or die in the attempt; we shall not live to see the perpetuation of our slavery.

“Here is a mantra, a short one, that I give you. You may imprint it on your hearts and let every breath of yours give expression to it. The mantra is: ‘Do or Die.’ We shall either free India or die in the attempt; we shall not live to see the perpetuation of our slavery. Every true Congressman or woman will join the struggle with an inflexible determination not to remain alive to see the country in bondage and slavery.”

“The call for 'Quit India' is also a call to each one of us to strive for the highest freedom, to strive for purity, and to strive for truth. Let there be no violence in our movement; let there be no hatred in our hearts. We must purge ourselves of anger, hatred, and malice. If we take to violence, we will not only destroy ourselves but we will also destroy the purpose of our movement.”

“We have to build the India of our dreams. We have to make India a land where the poorest will feel that it is their country, in whose making they have an effective voice. India is to be a country where there will be no high class and low class of people. All communities shall live in perfect harmony. There can be no room in such an India for the curse of untouchability or the curse of intoxicating drinks and drugs. Women will enjoy the same rights as men.”

“This is the India of my dreams. I shall work for an India in which the poorest shall feel that it is their country, in the making of which they have an effective voice; an India in which there shall be no high class and low class of people; an India in which all communities shall live in perfect harmony."
